# Open-GL 3D Rendering Framework

3D rendering framework built using modern OpenGL. This is still very much a work in progress and will serve as a test project for my level editor.

## Controls

- Use the scene menu in the top left corner to switch between scenes (scenes are completely destroyed and recreated every time you do this).
- Press escape to exit out of the scene and gain control over the mouse again.
- Middle mouse click to enter the scene again.
- All the textures and models are stored in the resources folder (res).
